      <h3>Straight Line Missions</h3>
      <p>The Idea of a Straight Line Mission has been probably invented, certainly made popular, by youtuber Tom Davis, AKA Geowizard, long time lover of mischief and adventure. In the winter of 2018 he attempted something that, as far as we know, has never been done before: Walk across an entire country in a straight line.<br>Ever since, people have been inspired by him and attempted the same across other countries, parks, states, provinces, areas, etc.<br>Whether you consider this a sport, a trend, or just a mad idea, it has a rapidly growing fan base and many people are trying to follow all the insane adventurers who take on this ordeal.</p>
